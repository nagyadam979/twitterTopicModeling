# Twitter Topic Modeling tutorial

Topic modeling is an extremely powerful data analysis tool, whereby text documents within a larger set are grouped together into sub-sets, based on the information content found within the documents. This unsupervised process automates the grouping of documents, making it a valuable tool in the analysis of large unstructured datasets. 

This is especially useful in the age of social media, with topic modeling often being used to evaluate online discourse related to a larger topic. In our example, we will be applying modern topic modeling techniques to a set of tweets (documents) generated using the *Twitter API**. This [tutorial](https://github.com/shaikadish/twitterTopicModeling/blob/main/twitterTopicModeling.ipynb) will explain the steps of this process, and the reasoning behind the various algorithms applied throughout.

The tutorial presented here is for people who already have a good understanding of NLP techniques such as vectorization and sentiment analysis, and aims to practically show how topic modeling can be applied to analyse large, real-world text datasets.
